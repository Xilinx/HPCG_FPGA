# High Performance Conjugate Gradient Benchmark (HPCG) - FPGA #


FPGA port from Xilinx Research Labs, forked from original HPCG Revision: 3.1 Date: March 28, 2019

## Introduction ##

HPCG is a software package that performs a fixed number of multigrid preconditioned
(using a symmetric Gauss-Seidel smoother) conjugate gradient (PCG) iterations using double
precision (64 bit) floating point values.

The HPCG rating is is a weighted GFLOP/s (billion floating operations per second) value
that is composed of the operations performed in the PCG iteration phase over
the time taken.  The overhead time of problem construction and any modifications to improve
performance are divided by 500 iterations (the amortization weight) and added to the runtime.

Integer arrays have global and local
scope (global indices are unique across the entire distributed memory system,
local indices are unique within a memory image).  Integer data for global/local
indices have three modes:

* 32/32 - global and local integers are 32-bit
* 64/32 - global integers are 64-bit, local are 32-bit
* 64/64 - global and local are 64-bit.

These various modes are required in order to address sufficiently big problems
if the range of indexing goes above 2^31 (roughly 2.1B), or to conserve storage
costs if the range of indexing is less than 2^31.

The  HPCG  software  package requires the availibility on your system of an
implementation of the  Message Passing Interface (MPI) if enabling the MPI
build of HPCG, and a compiler that supports OpenMP syntax. An implementation
compliant with MPI version 1.1 is sufficient.

## FPGA Implementation ##

The FPGA Implementation of HPCG focuses on implementing all the different kernels inside the benchmark in our design: Dot Product Multiplication (DP), Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication (SPMV), Symmetric Gauss-Seidel Smoother (SYMGS) and Vector Vector Co-efficient Multiplication (WAXPBY).

## Building for the FPGA ##

The FPGA implementation of HPCG has been developed keeping the same calculations as 
the original software version of HPCG implementing specific optimizations for multiple FPGA execution.<br/>
All the source code of the optimized version of HPCG is located in the `src-fpga` directory.<br/>
All the code has been designed to target the Alveo U280 FPGA, and can be run using one or multiple boards.<br/>
Execution of the benchmark requires XRT 2020.1, also Vitis 2020.1 is necessary to build both the kernels
and the host executable. <br/>
To build kernels simply navigate to the `src-fpga` directory and choose the desired precision for example: <br/>
`cd src-fpga/double`<br/>
From there type:<br/>
`make all TARGET=hw`
The Makefile looks for the Xilinx Alveo U280 platform (DSA version 2019.3) in the default installation path (/opt/xilinx/platforms).<br/>
If the path to the DSA is different, the user needs to specify the path when building the kernels in the following way:<br/>
`PLATFORM=/path_to_platform/xilinx_u280_xdma_201920_3.xpfm`<br/>
To build the host executable go in the home directory and choose which precision you used to build the binaries so 
that the host files are build accordingly, for example:<br/>
`make arch=FPGA_DOUBLE`.<br/>
This will generate the host executable that will target double precision operations.<br/>
Inside the `src-fpga/` directory multiple versions of the benchmark are present.<br/>
We implemented the Benchmark using different degrees of precision to test the performance of the FPGA.<br/>
If one desires to build for a lower precision than the one used normally in the Benchmark both host executable and FPGA build need to be adjusted accordingly.<br/>
To build for a lower precision simply go in the directory inside src-fpga and build for the FPGA in the same way as before:<br/>
`cd src-fpga/half`<br/>
`make all TARGET=hw`<br/>
This will build the kernels using half precision operations.<br/>
To build the host executable accordingly simply go into the home directory of the repository and type:
`make arch=FPGA_HALF`

## Executing on the FPGA ##

To execute the benchmark position yourself on the home directory of the repository and type:<br/>
`mpirun -n 1 /bin/xhpcg 64 64 64`<br/>
The syntax of the host executable is the following:<br/>
`mpirun -n <number_of_mpi_nodes> <path_to_hpcg_executable> <dim_x> <dim_y> <dim_z>`
To execute the benchmark on multiple nodes use a config file,
example configfiles are stored in the `configFile` directory.   
IP addresses of the other host machines need to be specified inside the configFile for proper execution.

## Installation ##

See the file `INSTALL` in this directory.

## Valid Runs ##

HPCG can be run in just a few minutes from start to finish.  However, official
runs must be at least 1800 seconds (30 minutes) as reported in the output file.
The Quick Path option is an exception for machines that are in production mode
prior to broad availability of an optimized version of HPCG 3.0 for a given platform.
In this situation (which should be confirmed by sending a note to the HPCG Benchmark
owners) the Quick Path option can be invoked by setting the run time parameter equal
to 0 (zero).

A valid run must also execute a problem size that is large enough so that data
arrays accessed in the CG iteration loop do not fit in the cache of the device
in a way that would be unrealistic in a real application setting.  Presently this
restriction means that the problem size should be large enough to occupy a
significant fraction of *main memory*, at least 1/4 of the total.

Future memory system architectures may require restatement of the specific memory
size requirements.  But the guiding principle will always be that the problem
size should reflect what would be reasonable for a real sparse iterative solver.
