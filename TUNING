 Performance Tuning and setting up the input data file HPCG.dat
 
 Current as of release HPCG - 0.4 - September 25, 2013
==============================================================
 Check out  the website  http://software.sandia.gov/hpcg for the
 latest information.

 After  having  built  the executable hpcg/bin/<arch>/xhpcg, one
 may want to modify the input  data  file  HPCG.dat.  This file
 should  reside  in  the  same  directory  as  the  executable 
 hpcg/bin/<arch>/xhpcg.  An example  HPCG.dat file is provided by
 default.  This  file  contains  information about the problem
 sizes,  machine configuration,  and  algorithm features to be
 used by the executable. It is 30 lines long. All the selected
 parameters  will  be  printed  in the output generated by the
 executable.

 At the end of this file,  there  is a couple of  experimental
 guide lines that you may find useful.

==============================================================
 File HPCG.dat (description):

 Line 1: (unused) Typically  one  would  use this line for its 
 own good. For example, it could be used to summarize the con-
 tent of the input file. By default this line reads:
 
 HPCG Linpack benchmark input file
 
 Line 2: (unused) same as line 1. By default this line reads:
 
 Sandia National Laboratories, University of Tennessee
 
 Line 3: the  user  can  choose where the output should be re-
 directed to.  In the case of a file, a name is necessary, and
 this  is  the  line  where one wants to specify it.  Only the
 first name on this line is significative. By default, the li-
 ne reads:
 
 HPCG.out  output file name (if any)
 
 This  means  that if  one chooses to redirect the output to a
 file, the file will be called "HPCG.out". The rest of the line
 is unused,  and this space to put some informative comment on
 the meaning of this line.
 
 Line 4: This line specifies  where the  output should go. The
 line is formatted, it must be a positive integer, the rest is
 unsignificant.  3 choices are possible for the positive inte-
 ger,  6 means that the output will go  the standard output, 7
 means  that the  output will go to the standard error. Any o-
 ther  integer  means  that  the  output  should be redirected
 to a file,  which  name has been specified in the line above.
 This line by default reads:
 
 6        device out (6=stdout,7=stderr,file)
 
 which  means  that  the  output generated  by  the executable
 should be redirected to the standard output.
 
 Line 5: This line specifies the number of problem sizes to be
 executed. This number should be less than or equal to 20. The
 first  integer  is  significant,  the rest is ignored. If the 
 line reads:
 
 3        # of problems sizes (N)
 
 this  means  that  the user is willing to run 3 problem sizes
 that will be specified in the next line.
 
 Line 6:  This  line  specifies the problem sizes one wants to 
 run.  Assuming  the  line  above  started with 3, the 3 first
 positive  integers  are significant, the rest is ignored. For
 example:
 
 3000 6000 10000    Ns
 
 means that one wants xhpcg to run 3 (specified in line 5) pro-
 blem sizes, namely 3000, 6000 and 10000.
