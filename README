 High Performance Conjugate Gradient Benchmark (HPCG)
 HPCG - 0.1 - August 22, 2013
==============================================================

 HPCG is a software package that performs a fixed number of
 symmetric Gauss-Seidel preconditioned conjugate gradient
 iterations using double precision (64 bit) floating point
 values.  Integer arrays have global and local scope (global
 indices are unique across the entire distributed memory 
 system, local indices are unique within a memory image).
 Integer data for global/local indices have three modes:
   32/32 - global and local integers are 32-bit.
   64/32 - global integers are 64-bit, local are 32-bit.
   64/64 - global and local are 64-bit.

 These various modes are required in order to address
 sufficiently big problem if the range of indexing goes
 above 2^31 (roughly 2.1B), or to conserve storage costs
 if the range of indexing is less than 2^31.

 The  HPCG  software  package requires the availibility on your
 system of an implementation of the  Message Passing Interface
 MPI  (1.1 compliant).
