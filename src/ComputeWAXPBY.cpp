/*!
  Routine to compute the update of a vector with the sum of two
  scaled vectors where: w = alpha*x + beta*y

  This routine calls the reference WAXPBY implementation by default, but
  can be replaced by a custom, optimized routine suited for
  the target system.

  @param[in] n the number of vector elements (on this processor)
  @param[in] alpha, beta the scalars applied to x and y respectively.
  @param[in] x, y the input vectors
  @param[out] w the output vector
  @param[out] isOptimized should be set to false if this routine uses the reference implementation (is not optimized); otherwise leave it unchanged

  @return returns 0 upon success and non-zero otherwise

  @see ComputeWAXPBY_ref
