 High Performance Conjugate Gradient Benchmark (HPCG)
 HPCG - 0.1 - August 22, 2013
==============================================================

 History

Version 0.1 HPCCG (Original version) - Written as a teaching code
for illustrating the anatomy of a distributed memory parallel
sparse iterative solver for new research students and junior 
staff members.  March 2000.

Version 0.2:
- Fixed bugs related to turning MPI compilation off.
- Added more text to README to improve understanding.
- Added new Makfile.x86linux.gcc for non-opteron systems.
- Made MPI_Wtime the default timer when in MPI mode.

Version 0.3:
- Fixed a performance bug in make_local_matrix.cpp that was 
  very noticeable when the fraction of off-processor grid 
  points was large.

Version 0.4:
- Made total_nnz a "long long" so that MFLOP numbers were valid
  when the nonzero count is  more than 2^31.

Version 0.5:
- Added timing for Allreduce calls in MPI mode, printing 
  min/max/avg times.
- Set the solver tolerance to zero to make all solves take 
  max_iter iterations.
- Changed accumulator to a local variable for ddot.  It 
  seems to help dual-core performance.

Version 1.0:
- Released as part of Mantevo Suite 1.0, December 2012.


NAME CHANGE: HPCCG to HPCG

Version 0.1:
- Added local symmetric Gauss-Seidel preconditioning.
- Changed global geometry to be true 3D.  Previously
  was a beam (subdomains were stacked only in the z
  dimension).
- Introduced three global/local index modes: 32/32, 64/32,
  64/64 to handle all problem sizes.
- Changed execution strategy to perform multiple runs with 
  just a few iterations per run.
- Added infrastructure and rules for user adaptation of
  kernels for performance optimization.
- Added benchmark modification and reporting rules.
- Changed directory and file layout to mimic TOP500 HPL 
  layouts.
