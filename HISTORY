===============
History of HPCG
===============

-----------
Version 0.1
-----------

* Added local symmetric Gauss-Seidel preconditioning.
* Changed global geometry to be true 3D.  Previously was a beam (subdomains
  were stacked only in the z dimension).
* Introduced three global/local index modes: 32/32, 64/32, 64/64 to handle all
  problem sizes.
* Changed execution strategy to perform multiple runs with just a few
  iterations per run.
* Added infrastructure and rules for user adaptation of kernels for performance
  optimization.
* Added benchmark modification and reporting rules.
* Changed directory and file layout to mimic HPL layouts where appropriate.

--------------------------
NAME CHANGE: HPCCG to HPCG
--------------------------

* The name was changed from HPCCG to HPCG without any code changes.

-----------
Version 1.0
-----------

* Released as part of Mantevo Suite 1.0, December 2012.

-----------
Version 0.5
-----------

* Added timing for Allreduce calls in MPI mode, printing min/max/avg times.
* Set the solver tolerance to zero to make all solves take ``max_iter``
  iterations.
* Changed accumulator to a local variable for ``ddot``.  It seems to help
  dual-core performance.

-----------
Version 0.4
-----------

- Made total_nnz a "long long" so that MFLOP numbers were valid
  when the nonzero count is  more than 2^31.

-----------
Version 0.3
-----------

* Fixed a performance bug in ``make_local_matrix.cpp`` that was very noticeable
  when the fraction of off-processor grid points was large.

-----------
Version 0.2
-----------

* Fixed bugs related to turning MPI compilation off.
* Added more text to README to improve understanding.
* Added new ``Makfile.x86linux.gcc`` for non-opteron systems.
* Made ``MPI_Wtime`` the default timer when in MPI mode.

Version 0.1

HPCCG (Original version) was written as a teaching code for illustrating the
anatomy of a distributed memory parallel sparse iterative solver for new
research students and junior staff members.  March 2000.
